# Whmcs-Client-Recurring-Price-Update
This addon allows you to update domains, products and addon prices by triggering WHMCS's Re-calculate on Save option in bulk. 

This is helpful when you want to change product pricing and apply the new pricing to existing client services.

The WHMCS bulk pricing updater can also do something similar, but it fails to take into account configurable options, which this will do automatically.

This will apply only to Active and Suspended services and addons or Active and Redemption status domains. It will not change prices for any other statuses, like cancelled, terminated. You can edit the code to add in the statuses you wish to utilize.

# Steps
- Select Product or Product Type
- Select Currency For which you want to Update Or select "All Currency" option</li>
- Click button and wait for process to complete
